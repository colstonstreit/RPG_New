# RPG_New

Welcome to my attempt at an RPG game / map editor written in Java.
I've always wanted to build my own game, and after many iterations, this is the farthest I've gotten.
Unfortunately, school has prevented me from working on it much recently, but I hope to update it more soon and improve things using the new skills I've learned in more recent CS classes.

In the meantime, enjoy what you see! Much of what is here is likely cringeworthy, and that's because this essentially has served as my playground of ideas. I've spent a lot of time making everything on here so far, and I've truly enjoyed it. I hope you can too!
